Reads a file from the local filesystem. Before using this tool, use other tools to locate where the file is. You can access any file directly by using this tool. Assume this tool is able to read all files on the machine. If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid, but if you cannot find the file from a partial path, use Glob or Grep to find the file. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.
